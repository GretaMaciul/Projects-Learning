    <h1>Cookie</h1>

    <p>A cookie is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking">baked</a> or cooked snack or <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert">dessert</a> that is
        typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains
        flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats,
        chocolate chips, nuts, etc.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>In many English-speaking countries outside North America, including the United Kingdom, the most common word for
        a
        crisp cookie is biscuit.[3] The term <b>cookie</b> is normally used to describe chewier ones.[3] However, in
        many
        regions
        both terms are used. The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.

        In Scotland the term cookie is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.[5]

        Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as individual
        pieces,
        are called in British English bar cookies or traybakes.</p>
    <h2>Classification</h2>

    <p>Cookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed or made, including at least these categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bar cookies consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in
            multiple layers) and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. In British English, bar cookies are known as
            "tray bakes".[3] Examples include brownies, fruit squares, and bars such as date squares.</li>
        <li>Drop cookies are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet.
            During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies), oatmeal
            raisin (or other oatmeal-based) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples of drop cookies. This may also
            include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon
            before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip.[17] In the UK, the term "cookie" often
            refers only to this particular type of product.</li>
        <li>Filled cookies are made from a rolled cookie dough filled with a fruit, jam or confectionery filling before
            baking. Hamantashen are a filled cookie.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Chocolate filled</li>
            <li>Caramel filled</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Other types of cookies are classified for other reasons, such as their ingredients, size, or intended time of
        serving:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Breakfast cookies are typically larger, lower-sugar cookies filled with "heart-healthy nuts and fiber-rich
            oats" that are eaten as a quick breakfast snack.</li>
        <li>Low-fat cookies or diet cookies typically have lower fat than regular cookies.</li>
    </ul>
