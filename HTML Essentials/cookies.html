            <h2>Terminology &#128214;</h2>
            <p>In many English-speaking countries outside North America, including the United Kingdom, the most common
                word
                for
                a
                crisp cookie is biscuit.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie#cite_note-:0-3">[3]</a></sup>
                The
                term <b>cookie</b> is normally used to describe chewier ones.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie#cite_note-:0-3">[3]</a></sup> However, in
                many
                regions
                both terms are used. The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.

                In Scotland the term cookie is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.[5]

                Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as
                individual
                pieces,
                are called in British English bar cookies or traybakes.</p>

        <h2>Classification &#9998;</h2>

        <p>Cookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed or made, including at least these categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bar cookies consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in
                multiple layers) and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. In British English, bar cookies are
                known as
                "tray bakes".[3] Examples include brownies, fruit squares, and bars such as date squares.</li>
            <li>Drop cookies are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet.
                During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies),
                oatmeal
                raisin (or other oatmeal-based) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples of drop cookies. This may
                also
                include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon
                before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip.[17] In the UK, the term "cookie"
                often
                refers only to this particular type of product.</li>
            <li>Filled cookies are made from a rolled cookie dough filled with a fruit, jam or confectionery filling
                before
                baking. Hamantashen are a filled cookie.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Chocolate filled</li>
                <li>Caramel filled</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>Other types of cookies are classified for other reasons, such as their ingredients, size, or intended time of
            serving:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Breakfast cookies are typically larger, lower-sugar cookies filled with "heart-healthy nuts and
                fiber-rich
                oats" that are eaten as a quick breakfast snack.</li>
            <li>Low-fat cookies or diet cookies typically have lower fat than regular cookies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Poem about cookies</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like a lot of people can relate<br>
            to the never-failing love for all the cookies on my plate.<br>
            <br>
            Sweet, delicate, chocolate chip.<br>
            I glance at the milk, then take a sip.<br>
            <br>
            Even raisin, sugar, or oatmeal<br>
            cause' any kind of cookie is a good deal.<br>
            <br>
            Every cookie, every crumb<br>
            these beauties make my heart go numb.<br>
            <br>
            The excitement within me grows and grows<br>
            at the pace of the aroma drifting into my nose.<br>
            <br>
            Without realizing, I may have eaten over thirty-one<br>
            Any regrets? ha! None.<br>
